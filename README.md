Image segmentation using K-means &amp; Mean Shift Algorithm

# Introduction
Image segmentation is used to separate an image into several “meaningful” parts. It is an old research topic, which started around 1970, but there is still no robust solution toward it. There are two main reasons, the first is that the content variety of images is too large, and the second one is that there is no benchmark standard to judge the performance.
